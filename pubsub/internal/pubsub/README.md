* Note: temp location only

This folder will actually be located at `google-cloud-go/internal/pubsub`. It is
here only for demonstration/prototyping purposes, to ensure pubsub tests pass.

The files in this folder will be reviewed in a separate PR and incorporated in a
new release of the `cloud.google.com/go` module, before updating the `pubsub`
module.
